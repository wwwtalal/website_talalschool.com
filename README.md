## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) must be installed on your system.

### Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/wwwtalal/website_talalschool.com.git
    cd website_talalschool.com
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start a local server at `http://localhost:5000` and automatically open it in your default browser. The command also runs a spell checker.

## üì¶ Build Process

To create an optimized version of the site for production, run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This script will:
1.  Clean the `docs/` directory.
2.  Copy all necessary assets (fonts, images, favicon, CNAME).
3.  Minify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
4.  Place the final, optimized site into the `docs/` directory, ready for deployment.
5.  Serve the built site at `http://localhost:8088`.
